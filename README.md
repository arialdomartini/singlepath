# SinglePath

Can you get rid of all the IFs?

## The game

Submit a snippet of code containing an ```if–then-else``` construct (or any other statements causing alternative paths of execution) 
and for which you believe the elimination of the conditional statement is impractical or too hard.

That is: send us a snippet of code that, in your opinion, *must* have an ```if-then-else```.

## The goal

Collectively refactor the code, with the manifest and deliberate goal of eliminating the conditional path.

Then, reflect on the result. Was it worth the effort?


## Rules

Everyone can submit a snippet of code. Just open a pull request.
Use the language you prefer: Java, C#, Python, what ever you want.
Just provide enough tests in order to make your intents clear.
